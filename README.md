# Exercises in Haskell

I created this repo to keep tracking of my Haskell learning process
in a way that I can revisit when learning new things and also
as a reference.

Feel free to use these under the terms of the MIT License, but be
aware of look at them only after trying to resolve the exercises
by yourself, or your future Haskell wings can be cut away.

Enjoy!
